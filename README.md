- 👋 Hi there, fellow digital explorer! I'm @DrDominicEtli, your not-so-ordinary blend of a healthcare provocateur, data enthusiast, and an academic maverick. I navigate the complex interplay between medicine, epidemiology, and the wild world of AI with the finesse of a ninja turtle at a pizza party. Yes, it's a spectacle!
- 👀 I’m deeply engrossed in the enigma that is the intersection of healthcare and artificial intelligence. Imagine a world where AI can predict an epidemic before it knocks on our door, or better yet, personalize your healthcare to the point where treatment plans are as unique as your DNA. Fascinating, isn't it?
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into the rabbit hole of algorithms and machine learning models. It’s like learning a new language, one that speaks in codes and can predict the future. Who wouldn't want to be a part of that?
- 💞️ I’m on the lookout to collaborate with like-minded rebels, thinkers, and dreamers. If you're someone who questions the status quo, challenges the conventional, and believes that the future of healthcare is as much about ethics and consent as it is about technology and science, then let's join forces.
- 📫 How to reach me? Ah, the million-dollar question. Carrier pigeons are a bit unreliable these days, so let's stick to the digital pigeons. Drop me a line at X @EthicalConsent. Let the collaboration begin!
- ⚡ Fun fact:  I've been lobbying for a Nobel Prize category in Sarcasm. I'm convinced my research on the therapeutic effects of witty banter could clinch the first award—if only the committee would take my calls seriously.
